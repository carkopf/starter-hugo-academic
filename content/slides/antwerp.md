## Two constraints on the neuroscience of content

- If measurements were good enough, is there any belief that could not be "read" off the relevant brain data? 
    
- My goal is to make progress on this question
    - I can't answer it directly, but hope to show how philosophical debates about *belief* bear on it.

### What is mindreading?

1. No conventional symbols
2. Driven by neural data
3. No rational reconstruction

This is the ideal. Real cases fall short. 

<!--
I argue in the published paper that real cases come close enough to this ideal that they should be considered real mindreading. This is not what matters here though. It is a bit like debates about free will. Or the superman/flight example. In any case I think everyone will agree that real cases fall short of this ideal. My goal here is not to say whether they fall too far short to be genuine, but rather to illustrate how one philosophical idea about the nature of belief suggests non-obvious ways in which real cases will fall short of this ideal.

### Rational reconstruction in an experimental setting

- Mindreading experiments typically involve predictions about stimuli. 
- There is a gap between stimulus prediction and propositional attitude ascription. 
- Predict trial with red square. Print: "She believes the square was red."
- Low-key form of rational reconstruction here.
