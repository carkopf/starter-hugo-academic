title: Strange error and the possibility of machine knowledge

event: Invited talk at the High Performance Computing Center at the University of Stuttgart
event_url: https://philo.hlrs.de/?p=204

location: Stuttgart

summary: Rather than merely demonstrating the fragility of ML models, strange error might be evidence of hidden knowledge. 

abstract: In this talk, I discuss how the phenomenon of strange error bears differently on two distinct but overlapping questions: (i) the possibility of using ML systems as sources of evidence for constructing human knowledge, and (ii) the possibility of ascribing knowledge to ML systems themselves.
