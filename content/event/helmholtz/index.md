title: "Deep learning models in science: some risks and opportunities" 

event: 'Helmholtz workshop on the ethics of AI in scientific practice'
event_url: 'https://philtechtalks.netlify.app/workshop/'

location: Jülich/Düsseldorf

summary:  "Under some conditions, we ought to trade interpretability for predictive power." 

abstract: "Deep neural networks offer striking improvements in predictive accuracy in many areas of science, and in biological sequence modeling in particular. But that predictive power comes at a steep price: we must give up on interpretability. In this talk, I argue - contrary to many voices in AI ethics calling for more interpretable models - that this is a price we should be willing to pay."
