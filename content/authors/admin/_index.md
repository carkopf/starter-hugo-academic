I am Permanent Research Associate in Philosophy and Neuroscience at the Jülich Research Center, and a lecturer at the University of Bonn. My research is in the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of science. Most of what I work on has to do with neuroscience and artificial intelligence, how these two fields are related to each other, and how scientific work in these fields relates to older philosophical ideas.
