abstract: In humans, the reuse of neural structure is particularly pronounced at
  short, task-relevant timescales. Here, an argument is developed for the claim
  that facts about neural reuse at task-relevant timescales conflict with at
  least one characterization of neural reuse at an evolutionary timescale. It is
  then argued that, in order to resolve the conflict, we must conceptualize
  evolutionary-scale reuse more abstractly than has been generally recognized.
  The final section of the paper explores the relationship between neural reuse
  and human nature. It is argued that neural reuse is not well-described as a
  process that constrains our present cognitive capacities. Instead, it
  liberates those capacities from the ancestral tethers that might otherwise
  have constrained them.
