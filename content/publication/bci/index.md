abstract: "When actions are mediated by means of a brain-computer interface, it seems that we cannot assess whether the user is culpable for the action without determining whether the brain-computer interface correctly decoded the intentions of the user. Here I argue that this requirement is confused. I also argue that, at least for the purposes of assessing moral culpability, BCI-mediated action should be viewed on the model of action Draft mediated by ordinary (albeit complex) tools."
