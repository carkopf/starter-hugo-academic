abstract: "Evaluating the cognitive capacities of large language models (LLMs) requires overcoming not only anthropomorphic but also anthropocentric biases. This article identifies two types of anthropocentric bias that have yet to receive critical attention: over-looking how auxiliary factors can impede LLM performance despite competence (Type-I), and dismissing LLM mechanistic strategies that dif- fer from those of humans as not genuinely com- petent (Type-II). Mitigating these biases necessitates an empirically-driven, iterative approach to mapping cognitive tasks to LLM-specific capacities and mechanisms, which can be done by supplementing carefully designed behavioral experiments with mechanistic studies."

title: "Anthropocentric bias and the possibility of artificial cognition"

summary: "When we use methods from experimental psychology to test the capacities of LLMs, we are prone to transfer assumptions about the human case to the LLM case, and to do so without justification. By drawing attention to these assumptions we can make more informed comparisons."
