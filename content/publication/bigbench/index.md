abstract: Language models demonstrate both quantitative improvement and new qualitative capabilities with increasing scale. Despite their potentiality for transformative impact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present and near-future capabilities limitations of language models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game Benchmark (BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 444 authors across 132 institutions.
