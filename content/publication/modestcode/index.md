abstract: "We argue that Brette's arguments, or some variation on them, work only against the immodest codes imputed by neuroscientists to the signals they study; they do not tell against 'modest' codes, which may be learned by neurons themselves. Still, caution is warranted: modest neural codes likely lead to only modest explanatory gains."
share: false
summary: The concept of neural coding makes sense, if the codes can be learned by neurons.
