abstract: Will brain imaging technology soon enable neuroscientists to read
  minds? We cannot answer this question without some understanding of the state
  of the art in neuroimaging. But neither can we answer this question without
  some under- standing of the concept invoked by the term “mind reading.” This
  article is an attempt to develop such understanding. Our analysis proceeds in
  two stages. In the first stage, we provide a categorical explication of mind
  reading. The categorical explication articulates empirical conditions that
  must be satisfied if mind reading is to be achieved. In the second stage, we
  develop a metric for judging the proficiency of mind reading experiments. The
  conception of mind reading that emerges helps to reconcile folk psychological
  judgments about what mind reading must involve with the constraints imposed by
  empirical strategies for achieving it.
