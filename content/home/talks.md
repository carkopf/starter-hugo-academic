Network functionalism

Deep neural networks behave like brains in various ways. Neuroscientists are using them as tools to explore hypotheses about how brains work. One way to think about these correspondences is by way of simulation. On that view, the correspondence between brains and neural networks is much like the correspondence between a climate model and the climate. The climate model can help you predict changes in precipitation patterns, but does not produce precipitation. Another way to think of these correspondences is by way of realization. On that view, the correspondence between brains and neural networks is much like the correspondence between a human brain and a mouse brain. The mouse brain can be used as a model of the human brain because, at some level of abstraction, it is doing exactly the same thing. Here, I explore which of these two options makes better sense, and settle on a conditional conclusion. The realization view can only be right if a theory I call network functionalism is correct.
