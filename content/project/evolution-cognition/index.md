summary: Thinking about how cognition evolved, both biologically and culturally, can help us understand what minds are.
abstract: One of the best ways to understand "the place of mind in nature" is Darwin's way: by thinking about how minds came to be. This topic is interesting in its own right. But it is also interesting because it provides resources for thinking about the minds of non-human agents.
