summary: Machines can now talk. Do they understand what they are saying?
abstract: When confronted with demonstrations of ChatGPT, the reaction is very often either that machines now understand language, or that they are nothing but stochastic parrots. The truth is likely more complicated than either response suggests, and also harder to articulate. We need more subtle ways of thinking about thinking machines, and I would like to contribute to that project.
